Coq proofs from ["Contracts Made Manifest" (Greenberg, Pierce, and Weirich POPL 2010)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1706299.1706341).

The lambdah_parred.tgz file should have a working version of the Metatheory library packaged with it.

This Coq development is essentially crapware, and is not maintained. I'm sorry.
